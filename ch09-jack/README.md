Tips
----

There can be only one bullet on the screen for each player, so fire your bullet when necessary. 

You cannot fire bullet when holding navigation key in the same time, thus it's better to press and loose navigation key quickly when changing direction. 

The game is designed for single round, which means if any player win, the program would halt. Dont't be addict to it!
