**DTank** is a simple game of *Dual Tanks* written in *Jack Language*. It's designed for two players, thus two TAs can enjoy it together. If you're along, :( you need to try it with two hands.

Operation
--------

There're two players in total. Player #1 starts from the up-left corner, while player #2 starts at bottom-right corner. The navigation keys for player #1 are arrow keys, and **FIRE** key is "P". To the contrary, the navigation keys for player #2 are "ASWD" keys, and **FIRE** key is *SPACE*.

Tips
----

There can be only one bullet on the screen for each player, so fire your bullet when necessary. 

You cannot fire bullet when holding navigation key in the same time, thus it's better to press and loose navigation key quickly when changing direction. 

The game is designed for single round, which means if any player win, the program would halt. Dont't be addicted to it :)
